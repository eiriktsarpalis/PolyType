# PolyType consumer test cases

This package is intended for consumption by your unit test project. It presents a bunch of types that help to exhaustively test your PolyType visitors.

```cs
[Theory]
[MemberData(nameof(TestTypes.GetTestCases), MemberType = typeof(TestTypes))]
public void Roundtrip_Value<T, TProvider>(TestCase<T, TProvider> testCase)
    where TProvider : IShapeable<T>
{
    T value = testCase.Value;
    Type type = testCase.Type;
    ITypeShape<T> shape = testCase.DefaultShape;

    // Exercise your code using these values...
}
```

There are other properties on the test case that may be helpful in knowing whether you can perform certain operations on the test case with an expectation of success.
